[00:25.00] Let me tell y'all what it's like
[00:27.26] Watchin' idol on a Friday night
[00:30.17] In a house built safe and sound
[00:32.31] On Indian burial ground
[00:34.48] Sham on
[00:37.98] 
[00:44.65] We drive our cars every day
[00:47.51] To and from work both ways
[00:50.03] So we make just enough to pay
[00:52.41] To drive our cars to work each day, hey-ey
[01:13.41] 
[01:04.27] We're rockin' the suburbs
[01:06.89] Around the block just one more time
[01:09.49] We're rockin' the suburbs
[01:11.89] 'Cause I can't tell which house is mine
[01:31.39] 
[01:14.32] We're rockin' the suburbs
[01:16.83] We part the shades and face facts
[01:20.18] They got better lookin' fescue
[01:22.35] Right across the cul-de-sac
[01:35.85] 
[01:35.64] Hotwheels take risin' stars
[01:38.00] Get rich quick seminars
[01:40.39] Soap opera magazines
[01:43.22] 40 thousand watt nativity scenes
[01:45.68] Don't freak about the smoke alarm
[01:50.45] Mom left the TV dinner on
[02:02.95] 
[01:54.62] Yet we're rockin' the suburbs
[01:57.21] From "Family Feud" to Chevy Chase
[01:59.62] We're rockin' the suburbs
[02:02.39] We numb the muscles in our face
[02:17.89] 
[02:04.97] We're rockin' the suburbs
[02:07.45] Feed the dog and mow the lawn
[02:09.84] Watchin' mommy balance the checks
[02:12.61] While daddy juggles credit cards
[02:28.61] 
[02:16.05] Hi, sorry to bother you
[02:18.90] The name's Bill
[02:19.88] I live just across the street
[02:21.16] Yeah, that's right over there
[02:22.38] No, no, not that house
[02:23.54] The one next to it with the extra flower bed
[02:25.69] Oh, and here's all your papers from the last few days
[02:28.32] They were just piling up on the driveway
[02:30.05] Where the whole neighborhood could see them
[02:31.66] Not that, that's a problem of course
[02:33.51] But that and the grass being a little overgrown
[02:35.55] Might give someone the impression that you were out of town
[02:37.85] And you wouldn't want that
[02:38.73] I've got to be going shortly to a little class I've been attending I just
[02:42.49] No, no, no, no, not pottery or anything like that it's uh...
[02:46.54] An anger management class actually
[02:48.99] And speaking of that very class
[02:51.12] They've been emphasising finding some common ground
[02:52.94] With people before you confront them
[02:54.78] To avoid becoming violent, you know?
[02:56.95] Well, actually, we do have a few things in common
[02:59.23] Here could you take these papers
[03:00.43] They're getting my suit wet
[03:02.08] And as I was say
[03:03.35] We do live on the same cul-de-sac
[03:05.05] That's common ground
[03:05.97] And I believe we actually have the same house plan
[03:08.22] Except the reverse, your garage is on the left and mine's on the...
[03:10.81] No, it wasn't me that dialled 911 at 6:31p.m, Wednesday
[03:16.21] About your son's noisy rock band
[03:17.64] Anyway, it's about your dog
[03:19.36] And of course about our garbage
[03:20.92] And the neighbor's garbage can
[03:22.42] No, I'm sorry; it is your dog
[03:23.93] Who's been strewing garbage around the block
[03:25.91] And I have digital evidence complete with red eye reduction
[03:29.07] Which I will e-mail to you to prove that it is in fact your dog
[03:32.32] Now I have to warn you that I have a black belt in in karate too
[03:34.73] And I'm certainly don't mind using it if necessary
[03:36.93] No, not on you man, on your stinking dog
[03:56.93] 
[03:41.38] We're rockin' the suburbs
[03:43.85] Everything we need is here
[03:46.69] We're rockin' the suburbs
[03:48.34] But it wasn't here last year
[04:02.34] 
[03:51.19] We're rockin' the suburbs
[03:53.97] You'll never know when we are gone
[03:56.08] Because the timer lights come on
[03:58.68] And turn the cricket noises on each night
[04:19.18] 
[04:04.10] Yeah, yeah, we're rockin' the suburbs
[04:09.33] Yeah, yeah, we're rockin' the suburbs
